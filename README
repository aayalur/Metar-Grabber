This is my open-source app that is currently published on the Android Market. It has just over 1,000 downloads and is compatible with Android 1.6 devices and higher. Feel free to play around with the code and do anything you like; it is a very simple app. This app retrieves the most current METAR and TAF data from supported airports around the world. Thanks!
